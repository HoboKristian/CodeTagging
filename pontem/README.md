# Pontem

This is the source code for the Pontem code tagging extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension was developed as part of the course project for CPSC 507 Advanced Software Engineering at the University of British Columbia. For background and usage information on the tool, please refer to the PontemPaper.pdf research paper in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HoboKristian/CodeTagging).

## Installation
The ./pontem folder contains all the necessary files for installing the extension in Visual Studio Code. For instructions on how to install an extension locally visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/yocode#_your-extensions-folder). 

## Basic Usage
Pontem allows developers to tag sections of code using a set of tag names that are defined by the user. The following shorcuts invoke the commands to use the tool:

* `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T` to tag the current code selection
* `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R` to isolate the workspace to a tag
* `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` to open the dashboard for an overview of the tags in the workspace

For more information regarding the functionality of the tool, refer to the research paper.
